# MultiModalMRI_Habits
Repository for the study "Characterizing habit learning in the human brain at the individual and group levels: a multi-modal MRI study" (Gera et al.)

* To use the codes some paths within the codes should be adjusted.
* The MRI (task-fMRI and DTI) analyses relies on the BIDS folder (can be found here https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds004299/versions/1.0.0) and the derivatives of fMRIprep.
